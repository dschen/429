# COS 429 Final Project: Helping the Color Blind See Color

## Carolyn Chen and Dorothy Chen

## To run:
with calibration:
```
runMe(/path/to/image/)
```
To run without calibration, hardcode the type of CVD and severity in runMe.

## To run simulation by itself:
```
simulate(imageRGB, type of CVD, 1)
```
